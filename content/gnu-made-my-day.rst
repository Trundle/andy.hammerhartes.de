   The file that would normally be displayed here (THE-GNU-PROJECT) has been moved
   to the emacs23-common-non-dfsg package because its
   license does not appear to be compatible with the Debian Free Software
   Guidelines (DFSG).  Please see
   /usr/share/doc/emacs23-common/copyright for more
   information.
   
   Please install THE-GNU-PROJECT from Debian's non-free distribution if you would
   like for Emacs to display the original file.
