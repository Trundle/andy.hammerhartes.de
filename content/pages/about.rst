I'm a software developer living in Munich.
	   
On this site I will almost exclusively ramble about
programming-related topics, mostly in German.

About this website
------------------

This website is generated from `reStructuredText`_ using
`Pelican`_. The theme is a custom theme made by me. The reason it
looks great anyway is because `other people
<http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ did most of the hard work. `Source can be
found on Github <https://github.com/Trundle/andy.hammerhartes.de>`_.
